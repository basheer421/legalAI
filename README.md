## About The Project

Welcome to the **Legal Agent** project! This platform is designed to help law firms and legal professionals automate the review and drafting of contracts using AI technology. It aims to provide a faster, more accurate, and compliant way to handle legal documents, reducing manual work and human errors. By integrating **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, the platform ensures efficient document analysis and compliance checks.

### About The Web Platform

Our web platform includes a variety of features tailored for legal professionals:

- **Chat with Contract**: Utilizing RAG technology for seamless chat with the uploaded contract based on UAE laws.
- **Automated Document Review**: AI-driven analysis of contracts, identifying key terms, risks, and compliance issues.
- **Compliance Check**: Ensure that your contracts and legal documents meet local and international standards.

- **Risk Prediction and Mitigation**: Use AI to predict potential risks in contracts and suggest mitigation strategies to reduce legal exposure.
- **Clause Recommendation Engine**: Suggest relevant clauses or terms based on the specific type of contract or legal requirement.
